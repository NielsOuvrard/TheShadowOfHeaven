## Summary

In Shadows of Heaven, the world is plunged into chaos after freemasons form an alliance with demons to construct seven Towers of Babel, each representing a deadly sin. These towers rip open the veil between realms, unleashing demonic forces and triggering the apocalypse. God sends Amos, a warrior angel, to destroy the towers and stop the corruption. Armed with divine light and celestial weapons, Amos must battle through waves of enemies, ascend each tower, and ultimately face Asrael, the Angel of Death, to decide the fate of humanity.

## Gameplay

_Shadows of Heaven_ features a cyclical gameplay loop of exploration and combat. Amos, the player-controlled angel, explores three of the seven Towers of Babel during the demo, fighting waves of demonic enemies.

At the start, Amos wields a melee weapon for close-range combat. As players ascend the towers, they unlock stronger weapons:

- **First Tower:** A revolver for ranged attacks.
- **Second Tower:** A shotgun for more powerful, close-range combat.
- **Third Tower:** A divine ray gun, capable of dealing immense damage.

This cycle of exploration, combat, and progressively stronger weapons keeps the gameplay engaging as Amos faces increasingly dangerous threats.

## Game World

The game is divided into three sections, each offering a new weapon and presenting tougher challenges than the previous one.

### Castle of Greed

Explore vast rooms filled with gold and jewels. This level introduces the basics, like melee attacks, dashing, and the use of the revolver. Although the halls sparkle with wealth, hidden dangers lie in wait as you navigate the treasure-laden environment.

### Tower of Betrayal

A cold, icy tower filled with sharp spikes and dangerous drops. Here, you obtain the Shotgun, which makes it easier to defeat enemies. The tower's layout is deceptive, with doors closing unexpectedly, making you question the path forward in this place of treachery.

### Tower of Wrath

Surrounded by fire and lava, this tower is filled with echoes of anger and pain. The Divine Light Ray, a powerful weapon, is found here. Every moment in this intense and dangerous tower tests your combat skills as you prepare for tougher enemies ahead.

## Game Experience

The first screen players encounter is the main menu, offering a 'Continue' button if progress has been made, or a 'Start' button for new players. If a game is ongoing, a level selector is available, alongside a 'Settings' button for adjusting controls, sound, and graphics.

As players advance through the towers, they will feel the thrill of escalating challenges, new enemies, and unexpected surprises. Combat intensity increases with rooms packed with enemies, where quick reflexes and strategic thinking are vital. Boss fights heighten the tension, demanding precision and focus, leaving players with a strong sense of achievement after each victory.

Exploration is key, with players excited to find hidden paths, secret rooms, and valuable consumables. The relief of discovering exits in maze-like areas provides moments of satisfaction. The game fosters anticipation, as each room holds the possibility of new challenges, treasures, or powerful weapons, keeping players engaged and on edge throughout the journey.

## Game Mechanics

### Movements

Amos can move in four directions, essential for dodging enemies and navigating the game world. The dash mechanic, unlocked later, allows quick escapes and faster movement, adding a strategic layer to the gameplay.

### Weapons

Each weapon has its own ammunition, found in chests or dropped by enemies. Ammunition is only available once the corresponding weapon is unlocked.

#### Melee Attack

Amos wields the Sword of Heaven, a divine weapon with a moderate damage output but limited range. The sword's celestial glow symbolizes its power, requiring Amos to be near enemies for effective strikes.

#### Revolver

A six-shooter that excels in precision and reliability, the revolver is slower to reload but offers high accuracy. Amos's skill ensures every shot hits its target, making it a trusted weapon for mid-range combat.

#### Shotgun

The shotgun delivers raw power in close-quarters combat, favoring overwhelming impact over precision. It's perfect for handling groups of enemies at close range with maximum efficiency.

#### Divine Light Ray

The Divine Light Ray is a celestial beam of holy energy, acting like a laser to pierce through enemies with divine precision. It is specifically designed to annihilate demons and dark entities, dealing significant damage.

## Obstacles

The obstacles in the game are manifestations of dark Freemason powers, designed to hinder the angels' progress. They challenge both physical movement and strategic thinking.

### Self-closing Doors

These doors close abruptly as players approach, forcing them to backtrack or find new routes. Some doors may reopen after solving puzzles or defeating enemies, adding a mental challenge to the game.

### Spike Floors

Spike floors are traps that activate intermittently, requiring players to time their movements to avoid being impaled. Patterns may be predictable or random, making quick reflexes essential.

### Lava Floors

Lava floors continuously deal damage while limiting movement. Players must plan their steps carefully, especially when combined with enemy encounters, adding significant risk to navigation.

## Enemies

The game's main enemies are Freemason sectarians and demons, each with a specific attack pattern and direct threat.

### Freemason Sectarians

They wield corrupted rifles that fire single bullets imbued with dark energy. These bullets deal direct damage without additional effects. When defeated, sectarians drop rifle ammunition and health points.

- **Corrupted Rifle:** Fires one bullet at a time, requiring players to dodge or take cover.

### Demons

Demons attack by launching fireballs that deal damage upon impact. These fireballs have no secondary effects, focusing purely on direct damage. Demons drop health points upon defeat, allowing players to recover.

- **Fireballs:** Direct projectiles that inflict damage when they hit the player, requiring swift dodging to avoid harm.

## Final Boss: Asrael

Asrael, the "Angel of Death," is a celestial entity cloaked in shadows, wielding dark power. He manipulates the Freemasons, convincing them to construct the Towers of Babel to reach divine energy hidden between Heaven and Earth. In the final battle, Asrael uses his divine sword and dark magic to challenge the player in a multi-phase combat.

### Battle Phases:

1. **Clones:** Asrael creates clones that must be destroyed before he can be harmed, hiding in the last one struck.
2. **Evil Light Thrower:** He unleashes dark orbs in a spiral pattern, filling the arena with deadly projectiles.
3. **Magic Light Rays:** Asrael fires beams of energy across the battlefield. After each attack, he becomes briefly vulnerable, allowing the player to strike.

This climactic fight represents Asrael’s immense dark and divine powers, challenging the player’s skill and strategy to restore balance between Heaven and Earth.

## Bonus Achievements

- **Angel’s Army:** Play in co-op mode with two or more players.
- **God’s Protection:** Complete the game without taking any damage.
- **No Mercy:** Defeat every single enemy from start to finish.
